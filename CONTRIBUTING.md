## How to Contribute

Any type of contribution is welcome. You can create an issue if you have a `question`, found a `bug`, or want to suggest a new `feature` or `refactoring`. You can also contribute directly by coding a solution and creating a Pull Request.

Another way to contribute is to browse through the issues and find one that you can help by contributing to its discussion or even coding and making a PR for that issue.

### Pull Requests

To contribute with a PR, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

3. Make your changes and submit a PR.
4. Wait for the PR to be reviewed by a repository administrator.
5. Communicate through the PR if necessary.
6. Make adjustments and send them to your branch copy if necessary.

Before submitting your PR, make sure that:

- Your PR contains a clear description of the problem it is solving and how it is solving it.
- Your PR is up-to-date with the main branch of the project.
- Your code is reviewed and tested.

### Communication

If you have any questions, suggestions, or criticisms, please create an issue in our repository. Make sure to describe the problem well, including a step-by-step reproduction of the problem, and if possible, screenshots or logs.

### Code Standards

Currently, this project does not have a formal style guide. However, we recommend that you observe the existing code to capture its style and follow an intuitive standard.

Some clear patterns are:

- Use whitespace instead of tabs. And use 2 (two) spaces for each level of indentation.
- Type names ends with `_t`.
- Variable and function names are in `snake_case`.

We are always open to discussing and adopting new code standards to make the project even more consistent and easy to maintain. If you feel that something needs to be discussed, feel free to create an issue for it.

### Commits

Make atomic and descriptive commits so we can easily track the history of changes.
